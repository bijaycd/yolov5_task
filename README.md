# yolov5_task

Workflow for YOLOv5 Task
1. Environment Setup
a. Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
- git clone https://github.com/bijaycd/yolov5_task.git
- cd yolov5_task
- b. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

bash
Copy code
- python -m venv yolov5_env
- source yolov5_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: yolov5_env\Scripts\activate
- pip install --upgrade pip
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If requirements.txt is not provided, manually install necessary packages such as torch, opencv-python, and PyYAML.

2. Data Preparation
a. Organize Dataset

Place your images and corresponding annotation files in the dataset directory. The structure should be:

markdown
Copy code
- dataset/
- ├── images/
- │   ├── img1.jpg
- │   ├── img2.jpg
- │   └── ...
- └── labels/
-     ├── img1.txt
-     ├── img2.txt
-    └── ...
b. Annotation Format

Ensure annotations are in YOLO format, where each .txt file contains:

php
Copy code
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
All values should be normalized between 0 and 1.

3. Data Loading
a. Review Dataloader.ipynb

Open the Dataloader.ipynb notebook to understand how data is loaded and preprocessed. This notebook demonstrates:

Loading images and annotations.
Applying transformations (e.g., resizing, augmentations).
Preparing data for training.
b. Customize as Needed

Modify the notebook to suit your dataset's specific requirements, such as custom augmentations or preprocessing steps.

4. Model Training
a. Review Training.ipynb

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training the YOLOv5 model, including:

Setting up the model architecture.
Defining hyperparameters.
Initiating the training loop.
Monitoring training metrics.
b. Configure Training Parameters

Adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to optimize performance for your specific dataset.

c. Start Training

Execute the cells in Training.ipynb to begin training. Monitor the loss and accuracy metrics to ensure the model is learning appropriately.

5. Evaluation
a. Model Assessment

After training, evaluate the model's performance using validation or test datasets. Check metrics like precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).

b. Inference on New Data

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images. Visualize the results to qualitatively assess performance.

6. Deployment
a. Save the Model

Once satisfied with the model's performance, save the trained weights for future use.

b. Implement in Applications

Integrate the trained model into your application pipeline for tasks such as real-time object detection or image analysis.

Note: Regularly update your environment and dependencies to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of libraries and tools.
